## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 The Opportunity

The B2B e-commerce platform market is projected to reach $25.65 trillion globally by 2028, growing at 14.5% CAGR (Grand View Research, 2024)[^1]. However, a significant gap exists: **73% of B2B buyers prefer digital self-service** (McKinsey, 2023)[^2], yet **only 17% of B2B companies have fully digital ordering capabilities** (Forrester, 2024)[^3].

**Prometheus** addresses this gap by providing a production-ready, white-label B2B ordering platform that technology partners (agencies, consultants, VARs) can license, rebrand, and deploy to their customers in weeks rather than months.

### 1.2 What We Do

Prometheus is a **white-label software licensing company** that develops and licenses enterprise-grade B2B ordering platforms. We enable:

- **Technology Partners** to offer sophisticated B2B platforms without development investment
- **End Customers** (distributors, manufacturers, wholesalers) to digitize their ordering processes
- **End Users** (buyers, procurement teams) to self-serve 24/7

### 1.3 Current Status

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Platform Development | Production-ready |
| Technology Stack | Next.js 16.1, React 19.2, .NET 9.0, PostgreSQL |
| Test Coverage | 95%+ (1,494 passing tests) |
| Code Quality | Enterprise-grade (CQRS, DDD patterns) |
| First Customer | MedSource (medical supply vertical) |
| Revenue | Pre-revenue (launching Q1 2026) |

### 1.4 Financial Projections (Conservative)

| Year | Revenue | Net Profit | Partners | Direct Customers |
|------|---------|------------|----------|------------------|
| Year 1 | $312,000 - $468,000 | $78,000 - $156,000 | 6-10 | 3-5 |
| Year 2 | $624,000 - $936,000 | $187,000 - $374,000 | 15-25 | 8-12 |
| Year 3 | $1,248,000 - $1,872,000 | $499,000 - $842,000 | 30-50 | 20-30 |

*Note: These projections use conservative assumptions with 40-60% probability. See Section 10 for methodology and scenarios.*

### 1.5 Funding Requirements

| Option | Amount | Use of Funds |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Bootstrap | $75,000 - $125,000 | Legal, marketing, initial operations |
| Seed (Optional) | $500,000 - $750,000 | Sales team, accelerated growth |

### 1.6 Key Risks (Acknowledged)

1. **Market Risk**: B2B software sales cycles average 4.5 months (not weeks)
2. **Competition Risk**: Established players (OroCommerce, BigCommerce B2B) have brand recognition
3. **Execution Risk**: Single founder dependency in early stages
4. **Revenue Risk**: Partner model requires partners to successfully sell
5. **Technology Risk**: Continuous investment needed to maintain competitive parity

*These risks are addressed in detail in Section 11.*

## 2. Company Overview

### 2.1 Mission Statement

To democratize enterprise-grade B2B ordering technology by enabling technology partners to deliver sophisticated platforms to their customers without multi-million dollar development investments.

### 2.2 Vision

By 2030, Prometheus will power 500+ B2B ordering implementations across North America, enabling $10+ billion in annual transaction volume through partner-deployed platforms.

### 2.3 Company Information

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Legal Name** | Prometheus Technologies LLC (to be formed) |
| **Headquarters** | Miami, Florida |
| **Entity Type** | Florida LLC (converting to Delaware C-Corp if raising) |
| **Founded** | 2024 (development phase) |
| **Launch** | Q1 2026 |
| **Team Size** | 1 (Founder/Developer) |

### 2.4 Founding Team

**Founder/CEO/CTO**: Full-stack developer with expertise in:

- DevOps: Docker, CI/CD, Cloud deployment

**Experience**: Built Prometheus Platform from concept to production over 18 months, representing 3,200-4,100 development hours.

### 2.5 Why Miami

Miami's selection is strategic, not arbitrary:

1. **Latin America Gateway**: 50%+ of Fortune 500 LATAM headquarters are in Miami (Miami-Dade Beacon Council, 2024)[^4]
2. **Growing Tech Ecosystem**: 34% YoY growth in tech employment (CompTIA, 2024)[^5]
3. **Distribution Hub**: Port Miami handles 1.1M+ TEUs annually (Port Miami, 2024)[^6]
4. **Tax Efficiency**: No state income tax
5. **Cost Arbitrage**: 40% lower operating costs than SF/NYC (Numbeo, 2024)[^7]

**Risk Acknowledgment**: Miami's tech ecosystem is less mature than established hubs. Recruiting senior talent may require remote arrangements or premium compensation.

## 3. Problem Statement & Market Opportunity

### 3.1 The Problem

**For Technology Partners (Agencies, Consultants, VARs)**:

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Custom B2B platform development costs $300,000-$800,000 | Partners cannot afford to build for speculation |
| Development takes 12-18 months | Opportunity cost of delayed revenue |
| Ongoing maintenance costs $60,000-$120,000/year | Margins eroded by support burden |
| Technical expertise gaps | Risk of project failure |

**For End Customers (Distributors, Wholesalers)**:

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Manual ordering via phone, fax, email | Average order processing cost: $50-$150/order (Aberdeen Group)[^8] |
| Quote management in spreadsheets | 15-20% of quotes never converted (lack of follow-up) |
| No self-service for buyers | Missed after-hours orders (estimated 23% of demand)[^9] |
| Limited visibility into sales performance | Suboptimal territory and rep assignments |

### 3.2 The Solution

Prometheus provides **production-ready, white-label B2B ordering platforms** that:

1. **Reduce Partner Risk**: No development investment, proven platform
2. **Accelerate Time-to-Revenue**: Realistic deployment timelines (see below)
3. **Enable Recurring Revenue**: Partners generate monthly SaaS revenue
4. **Solve Real Problems**: Quote management, self-service ordering, analytics

#### Implementation Truth Table

| Deployment Type | Timeline | What's Included | What's NOT Included |
|-----------------|----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Pilot (First Order)** | 2-4 weeks | Template config, sample data, 3-5 users, basic training | ERP integration, full catalog, all users |
| **Standard Rollout** | 8-12 weeks | Full catalog import, all users, custom branding, training | ERP integration, custom workflows |
| **Full Enterprise** | 12-20 weeks | Everything above + ERP integration + custom workflows + UAT | Multi-region, custom development |

**Critical Honesty**: "2-4 weeks to first order" is achievable. "2-4 weeks to full production" is not. We communicate this clearly to partners and customers.

### 3.3 Market Opportunity

#### 3.3.1 Total Addressable Market (TAM)

The global B2B e-commerce platform market:
- **2024**: $9.12 billion
- **2028**: $25.65 billion (projected)
- **CAGR**: 14.5%

*Source: Grand View Research, "B2B E-commerce Platform Market Size Report," 2024[^1]*

#### 3.3.2 Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)

White-label/reseller segment of B2B platforms in North America:
- **Estimated**: $1.2 - $1.8 billion
- **Basis**: 12-18% of total market value flows through partner/reseller channels

#### 3.3.3 Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

Realistic Year 3 target:
- **Target**: $1.5 - $2.5 million (0.08-0.14% of SAM)
- **Basis**: 30-50 active partners, 20-30 direct customers

**Market Size Caveats**:
- TAM figures include all B2B platforms, not just ordering-focused
- White-label segment estimates are derived, not directly measured
- Actual obtainable market depends on execution quality and competitive dynamics

### 4.5 White-Label Capabilities

Partners can customize:
- Company name and branding
- Logo and color scheme
- Custom domain (e.g., orders.partnercompany.com)
- Email templates
- Customer-facing terminology

Partners **cannot** customize:
- Core workflow logic
- Database schema
- API endpoints
- Security model

### 4.6 Configuration vs. Customization Policy

**This is Critical**: Without hard boundaries, we become a services company disguised as SaaS.

#### What Partners CAN Configure (Self-Service)

| Configuration | Description | Support Level |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Branding** | Logo, colors, fonts | Self-service |
| **Terminology** | Field labels, menu names | Self-service |
| **Custom Domain** | orders.partner.com | Guided setup |
| **Email Templates** | Order confirmations, quotes | Template editor |
| **Product Categories** | Industry-specific categories | Admin panel |
| **Pricing Rules** | Discount tiers, volume pricing | Admin panel |
| **User Roles** | Permission modifications | Admin panel |
| **Workflow Triggers** | Notification rules, approvals | Admin panel |

#### What Partners CANNOT Customize

| Restriction | Reason | Alternative |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Core Workflow Logic | Platform consistency | Feature requests → roadmap |
| Database Schema | Multi-tenant integrity | API for external data |
| API Endpoints | Version stability | Webhook integrations |
| Security Model | Compliance requirements | Configuration only |
| Authentication Flow | Security standardization | SSO integration |

#### How We Enforce This

1. **Clear Contract Language**: Partner agreement explicitly lists what's included
2. **No Custom Code Deployments**: All partners run same codebase
3. **Feature Request Process**: Partners submit requests, we prioritize for all
4. **Configuration-Only Support**: Support team trained to solve with config, not code

**Promise**: Configuration flexibility with platform consistency. No exceptions.

## 6. Competitive Landscape

### 6.0 Complete Competitor Landscape (3-Tier Analysis)

Understanding where we compete (and where we don't) is critical. Our competitors fall into three distinct tiers:

#### Tier 1: Enterprise Commerce Platforms (Not Direct Competitors)

These platforms are often mentioned in B2B commerce discussions, but serve fundamentally different markets:

| Platform | B2B Features | Pricing | Why We Win Anyway |
|----------|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Shopify B2B (Plus)** | Company accounts, payment terms, catalogs, quantity rules, draft orders | $2,300+/mo (requires Plus) | No white-label capability. Partner economics don't work. Catalog-first, not quote-first. |\n| **Adobe Commerce (Magento)** | Negotiated quotes, company accounts, requisition lists, shared catalogs | $50K-$200K/year + implementation | 6-12 month implementations. Requires developer team. Recent security vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-54236). |\n| **BigCommerce B2B Edition** | Quote management, buyer portals, customer groups, price lists | $29K-$150K/year | Not partner-first. E-commerce DNA, not distribution DNA. |\n| **Salesforce Commerce Cloud** | B2B Commerce, CPQ integration, Einstein AI | $150K-$500K/year | Requires Salesforce ecosystem. Enterprise-only. Extremely complex. |\n| **SAP Commerce Cloud** | Full B2B suite, ERP integration | $200K+/year | Enterprise suite gravity. Requires SAP stack. |\n| **Optimizely Configured Commerce** | Configure-price-quote, product configurator | $75K-$200K/year | Manufacturing-focused. Complex implementations. |

**Our Position vs. Tier 1**: These platforms serve merchants who want to ADD B2B capabilities. We serve distributors whose ENTIRE business model is B2B quote-based sales. Different use case, different buyer.

#### Tier 2: Composable/API-First Platforms (Different Market Segment)

These platforms target enterprises with engineering teams:

| Platform | Focus | Pricing | Why We Don't Compete |
|----------|-------|---------|---------------------|
| **commercetools** | API-first composable commerce | $100K+/year | Requires full engineering team. Our customers have zero developers. |
| **Elastic Path** | API-first flexibility | $100K+/year | Enterprise-only, developer-required, 6+ month implementations. |
| **Spryker** | Composable commerce | Enterprise custom | European focus, complex implementations, requires significant technical resources. |

**Our Position vs. Tier 2**: These platforms require building your own frontend. We provide complete, ready-to-deploy solutions.

#### Tier 2.5: B2B-First Mid-Market Platforms (Direct Competition)

These are our most direct competitors—purpose-built for B2B with similar target markets:

| Platform | Focus | Pricing | Competitive Position |
|----------|-------|---------|---------------------|
| **Pepperi** | Unified B2B commerce + sales rep ordering + mobile | Quote-based (est. $30K-$100K/year) | Strong sales rep workflows, mobile ordering maturity, vertical playbooks. We compete on white-label economics and partner-first model. |
| **Sana Commerce** | ERP-integrated B2B commerce (SAP + Microsoft Dynamics) | Quote-based (est. $25K-$150K/year) | Deep ERP integration is their moat. We win with faster implementation and lower entry cost when ERP integration isn't critical. |
| **Unilog CX1 / CIMM2** | Punchout + procurement integration, distributor-focused | Quote-based (est. $40K-$120K/year) | Procurement/punchout specialists. We win on modern UX and quote workflow when punchout isn't the primary use case. |
| **Znode** | B2B commerce on .NET stack, headless-capable | Quote-based (est. $30K-$100K/year) | Same tech stack advantage. They target developers; we target partners. Different go-to-market, similar capability. |

**Why These Matter**: Buyers doing diligence will find these platforms. We must be prepared to articulate our differentiation clearly:

| Their Advantage | Our Counter |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Established customer base + references | MedSource case study + partner-driven reference network |
| Mature ERP integrations | Faster time-to-value when ERP integration isn't day-one requirement |
| Sales rep mobile apps | Responsive web app works on mobile; native app on Year 2 roadmap |
| Enterprise support infrastructure | White-glove partner support; partners provide front-line support |

**Pricing Note**: Competitor pricing is quote-based and not publicly disclosed. Estimates above are based on industry analyst reports and customer interviews, labeled as estimates. We do not invent specific numbers.

#### Tier 3: Direct Competitors (Where We Actually Compete)

### 6.1 Direct Competitors

| **Strengths** | Brand recognition, app ecosystem, marketing |
| **Weaknesses** | E-commerce DNA (not quote-focused), expensive |

**Competitive Position**: BigCommerce is primarily B2C-adapted-to-B2B. We're purpose-built for quote-based B2B workflows.

#### 6.1.3 Virto Commerce

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Company** | Virto Commerce (Los Angeles, CA) |
| **Founded** | 2014 |
| **Target** | Enterprise, marketplace builders |
| **Pricing** | $199/mo (cloud) to custom enterprise |
| **Technology** | .NET Core, headless, modular |
| **Strengths** | Same tech stack as us, modular, marketplace support |

**Competitive Position**: Virto is technically similar but targets developers directly. We target partners who serve end customers.

#### 6.1.4 Industry-Specific Solutions

| Competitor | Vertical | Pricing | Notes |
|------------|----------|---------|-------|
| **Distribution One** | All distribution | $50K+/year | Full ERP, not just ordering |
| **Epicor Prophet 21** | Distribution | $100K+/year | Legacy, being modernized |
| **Infor CloudSuite** | Distribution | $100K+/year | Enterprise only |
| **Cin7** | Inventory-focused | $349-$999/mo | Strong inventory, weak ordering |

### 6.2 Competitive Differentiation Matrix

| Factor | Prometheus | OroCommerce | BigCommerce B2B | Virto |
|--------|------------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| **White-Label Ready** | ✅ Full | ⚠️ Limited | ❌ No | ✅ Full |
| **Quote-Based Workflow** | ✅ Native | ✅ Native | ⚠️ Add-on | ⚠️ Custom |
| **Partner Program** | ✅ Focus | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Limited |
| **Implementation Time** | 2-4 weeks | 3-6 months | 2-4 months | 3-6 months |
| **Entry Price** | $25K license | $50K+/year | $29K+/year | $199/mo+ |
| **Technical Debt** | Low (new) | Medium | Medium | Low |
| **Modern Stack** | ✅ Latest | ⚠️ Aging | ✅ Modern | ✅ Modern |
| **Payment Processing** | ❌ Planned | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **ERP Integrations** | ❌ Planned | ✅ Many | ✅ Many | ✅ Many |

### 6.3 Competitive Risks (Honest Assessment)

1. **Brand Recognition**: Competitors have years of market presence and case studies
2. **Feature Completeness**: We lack payment processing and ERP integrations (critical gaps)
3. **Ecosystem**: Competitors have established partner networks and app marketplaces
4. **Resources**: Competitors have dedicated sales, marketing, and support teams
5. **Switching Costs**: Once customers implement competitors, switching is expensive

### 6.4 Our Competitive Advantages (Realistic Assessment)

**Honest Truth**: We do NOT have a traditional "moat." We are a pre-revenue startup competing against funded, established players. What we have are **temporary advantages** that we must convert into defensible positions through execution.

#### Advantages We Have Today (Must Prove)

| Advantage | Description | How We Prove It | Risk If Unproven |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Vertical Focus** | Purpose-built for medical supply distribution (not generic B2B commerce). Data models, workflows, and terminology are opinionated for this vertical. | Ship 3+ partners in medical supply vertical with documented success. | Becomes generic platform competing on features (we lose). |
| **Partner Economics** | Partners keep 80% of customer revenue (vs. typical 50-60%). Lower barrier ($15K-$50K vs. $100K+ implementation). | 5+ active partners, 90%+ retention after Year 1. | Partners don't sell effectively; model doesn't scale. |
| **Implementation Speed** | 2-4 weeks to first order (8-12 weeks standard rollout). Configuration-based, not development-based. | Track and publish actual implementation timelines. | Implementations take longer; speed claim becomes liability. |
| **Cost Structure** | Lower operating costs via efficient development practices. Enables sustainable pricing below competitors. | Maintain 85%+ gross margins at current pricing. | Margins compress; must raise prices or cut features. |

#### What We Do NOT Have (Honesty)

| NOT a Moat | Why | Reality |
|------------|-----|---------|
| **"AI-assisted development"** | Every competitor and new entrant uses AI tools now. This is table stakes, not differentiation. | We're faster today, but this advantage erodes as AI becomes ubiquitous. |
| **"Customer intimacy at scale"** | This is founder bandwidth, not a moat. It doesn't scale and creates key-person risk. | We must systematize partner success before Year 2 or this becomes a bottleneck. |
| **Technology stack advantage** | .NET 9 + Next.js 16 + React 19 is modern, but competitors can (and will) upgrade. | Stack is execution enabler, not long-term moat. |
| **Pricing advantage** | Lower prices attract customers, but competitors can respond with discounts or bundles. | We must deliver value that justifies pricing, not just undercut. |

#### Building Real Defensibility (12-24 Month Horizon)

True moats take time to build. Here's our path:

| Future Moat | How We Build It | Timeline |
|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Network Effects (Partner)** | As partners succeed, they refer other partners. Partner success stories become marketing. | Year 2+ |
| **Switching Costs** | Customer data, workflows, integrations create lock-in. | After 6+ months of customer usage |
| **Ecosystem** | Partner-built integrations, templates, vertical extensions. | Year 2-3 |
| **Brand/Trust** | SOC 2 certification, published case studies, industry recognition. | Year 1-2 |
| **Data Advantage** | Aggregated insights across deployments inform product improvements. | Year 2+ (requires scale) |

**Critical Insight**: Our current advantages are execution-dependent, not structural. We must convert temporary advantages into defensible positions through successful partner deployments, case studies, and systematic operations.

### 6.5 Competitive Strategy

**Positioning**: "The Partner-First B2B Platform"

We compete by:
1. **Focusing on Partners**: Help partners succeed, not just sell software
2. **Simplicity**: Purpose-built for quote-based ordering, not trying to be everything
3. **Modern Technology**: Latest stack (Next.js 16, React 19, .NET 9) vs. aging competitors
4. **Pricing**: Lower entry point for partners ($25K vs. $50K+)
5. **Speed**: 2-4 week implementation vs. months

**We Avoid**:
- Enterprise deals requiring complex implementations
- Customers needing extensive ERP integrations (until Phase 1 complete)
- Price-sensitive customers who won't value quality

## 7. Business Model

### 7.1 Revenue Model

#### 7.1.1 Stream 1: Partner Licensing (Target: 70% of Revenue)

| Component | Amount | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Upfront License Fee** | $15,000 - $50,000 | One-time, based on partner tier |
| **Revenue Share** | 15-25% | Of partner's customer MRR |
| **Annual Maintenance** | Included | Updates, security patches |

**Partner Economics Example**:
```
Partner: Healthcare IT Consultancy
License Fee: $25,000 (one-time)
Customer Acquisition: 3 customers @ $2,000/month each = $6,000/month
Revenue Share (20%): $1,200/month to Prometheus
Partner Retains: $4,800/month (80%)

Partner Break-Even: 5.2 months
Partner Year 1 Revenue: $57,600 - $25,000 = $32,600 net
Partner Year 2 Revenue: $57,600 (pure margin after break-even)
```

#### 7.1.2 Stream 2: Direct SaaS (Target: 30% of Revenue)

| Tier | Monthly Price | Target Customer |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Starter** | $499/month | 1-5 sales reps, basic features |
| **Professional** | $1,499/month | 6-15 sales reps, analytics |
| **Enterprise** | $3,000-$5,000/month | 16+ reps, custom integrations |

**Direct Customer Economics**:
```
Customer: Miami Medical Supply ($20M revenue, 10 sales reps)
Plan: Professional @ $1,499/month
Annual Cost: $17,988
Value Delivered:
- Time savings: 10 reps × 5 hours/week × $50/hour = $130,000/year
- Error reduction: 5% fewer order errors × $15M orders = $75,000/year
- Self-service orders: 10% of orders self-served = $20,000 savings
ROI: 12.5× ($225,000 value / $17,988 cost)
```

### 7.2 Pricing Strategy

#### 7.2.1 Partner Licensing Tiers

| Tier | Upfront | Revenue Share | Support | Target Partner |
|------|---------|---------------|---------|----------------|
| **Agency Starter** | $15,000 | 25% | Email (48h) | Small agencies (5-20 employees) |
| **Agency Growth** | $25,000 | 20% | Email (24h) + Phone | Mid-size agencies (20-50 employees) |
| **VAR/Consultant** | $40,000 | 15% | Priority (4h) + Dedicated | Large partners (50+ employees) |
| **Enterprise** | $75,000-$150,000 | 10% or flat | White-glove | PE firms, large VARs |

#### 7.2.2 Pricing Justification

**For Partners**:
- Custom development alternative: $300,000 - $800,000
- Our license: $15,000 - $50,000 (95% savings)
- Time to market: 2-4 weeks vs. 12-18 months
- Ongoing maintenance included (vs. $60,000-$120,000/year)

**For Direct Customers**:
- Industry average for B2B platforms: $2,000 - $5,000/month
- Our pricing: $499 - $5,000/month (competitive to below market)
- ROI payback: 1-3 months for most customers

### 7.3 Unit Economics

#### 7.3.1 Partner Unit Economics

| Metric | Value | Calculation |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** | $5,000 - $8,000 | Sales time + marketing |
| **Upfront Revenue** | $25,000 | Average license fee |
| **LTV (Year 1)** | $25,000 + $4,800 | License + revenue share |
| **LTV (3 Year)** | $25,000 + $14,400 | License + 3 years revenue share |
| **LTV:CAC** | 5:1 - 8:1 | Healthy ratio |

*Assumptions: Average partner has 2 customers generating $2,000/month each, 20% revenue share*

#### 7.3.2 Direct SaaS Unit Economics

| Metric | Value | Calculation |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** | $8,000 - $15,000 | Longer sales cycle |
| **Monthly Revenue** | $1,499 | Professional tier average |
| **Annual Contract Value (ACV)** | $17,988 | $1,499 × 12 |
| **Gross Margin** | 85% | After hosting costs |
| **LTV (3 Year, 10% churn)** | $43,200 | $17,988 × 2.4 |
| **LTV:CAC** | 3:1 - 5:1 | Acceptable ratio |

### 7.4 Revenue Share Mechanics (Detailed)

**How Revenue Share Works**:

1. Partner reports monthly customer revenue via portal
2. Invoice generated automatically on 1st of each month
3. Payment due within 15 days (Net-15)
4. Quarterly audits to verify reported revenue

**Revenue Share Fairness**:

| We Provide (Worth 20%) | Partner Provides (Worth 80%) |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Production-ready platform | Customer acquisition (20-40 hours/deal) |
| Managed hosting infrastructure | Sales process (2-6 week cycles) |
| Continuous security updates & patches | Customer onboarding (10-20 hours) |
| Ongoing feature development | Ongoing support (5-10 hours/month) |
| Tier 2/3 technical support | Customer relationship management |
| Sales enablement & training | Revenue risk (if customer churns) |

*Note: The 80/20 revenue split reflects the reality that partners do the hard work of finding customers, closing deals, implementing solutions, and maintaining relationships. We provide the platform infrastructure and ongoing development.*

| Customer churn | <15% | <25% | <40% |

### 11.4 Security & Trust Roadmap

**Why This Matters**: Security breaches can destroy multi-tenant platforms. As the shared backbone for partner deployments, one serious incident could kill the entire company. Our security posture must be proactive, not reactive.

**Our Security Philosophy**: We run managed hosting with aggressive patch SLAs, secure defaults, and proactive vulnerability management. We differentiate on our security *program*—detection speed, response time, and process maturity—not on competitors' incidents.

#### Current Security Posture

| Security Layer | Status | Implementation |
|----------------|--------|----------------|
| Authentication | ✅ Production | OAuth 2.0/OIDC via OpenIddict |
| Authorization | ✅ Production | Role-based + Permission-based (5-tier) |
| Tenant Isolation | ✅ Production | EF Core filters + PostgreSQL RLS |
| Input Validation | ✅ Production | FluentValidation on all endpoints |
| API Rate Limiting | ✅ Production | Per-tenant throttling |
| Audit Logging | ✅ Production | Serilog structured logging |
| Encryption at Rest | ✅ Production | Azure Database encryption |
| Encryption in Transit | ✅ Production | TLS 1.3 everywhere |

#### Trust Roadmap (Year 1-2)

| Milestone | Timeline | Cost | Benefit |
|-----------|----------|------|---------|
| **Automated Dependency Scanning** | Month 1 | $0 (GitHub Dependabot) | Catch vulnerable packages before deploy |
| **Penetration Testing** | Month 3, then annually | $5,000-$10,000/year | Third-party validation |
| **Security Incident Response Plan** | Month 2 | $0 (internal) | Documented response procedures |
| **SOC 2 Type I** | Month 6-9 | $15,000-$25,000 | Enterprise sales requirement |
| **SOC 2 Type II** | Month 12-18 | $25,000-$40,000 | Enterprise trust + reduced insurance |
| **Bug Bounty Program** | Month 12+ | $5,000-$15,000/year | Continuous security testing |

#### Patch Management Process

| Severity | Response Time | Action |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| **Critical** (RCE, auth bypass) | < 24 hours | Emergency patch, notify all partners |
| **High** (data exposure risk) | < 72 hours | Prioritized patch, partner advisory |
| **Medium** (limited impact) | < 2 weeks | Scheduled release |
| **Low** (minimal risk) | Next release | Bundled with features |

#### Tenant Isolation Guarantee

Multi-tenant architecture is tested via:
1. **Automated Tests**: 200+ tenant isolation tests in CI/CD
2. **Manual Penetration**: Annual third-party testing specifically targeting cross-tenant access
3. **Defense in Depth**: EF Core query filters + PostgreSQL RLS + API authorization = 3 layers

**Commitment**: If a tenant isolation failure is discovered, affected partners receive prorated refunds and priority remediation.

### 11.5 Risk Mitigation Investments

| Investment | Cost | Risk Mitigated |
|------------|------|----------------|
| SOC 2 Type II certification | $25,000 - $50,000 | Security, enterprise sales |
| Legal contracts review | $10,000 | Liability, IP protection |
| Cyber insurance | $3,600/year | Breach liability |
| Penetration testing | $5,000 - $10,000/year | Security vulnerabilities |
| Backup founder coverage | $0 (documentation) | Key person risk |
